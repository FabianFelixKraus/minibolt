Based on [RaspiBolt guide v3](https://github.com/raspibolt/raspibolt), originally made by Stadicus and now maintained for the community, those are the most relevant changes:

- Changed OS from Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bits) to **Ubuntu Server LTS 64-bit** - PC (AMD64)
- Changed binaries and signatures of the programs to adapt them to **x86/amd64** architecture processors
- Deleted unnecessary tools and steps, and added others according to this case of use
- Added some useful authentication logs monitoring commands in the security section
- Added interesting parameters in the configuration of some services and related commands to activate and take advantage of new features
