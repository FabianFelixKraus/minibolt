# Cloudflare Tunnel

Cloudflare tunnel offers an alternative to those solutions with a single downside: Cloudflare can see or modify all of your traffic, as it acts as a middleman between the client's browser and your local server.

With Cloudflare tunnel, you will enjoy low latency access to your server, on clearnet, and WITHOUT the need to configure your Firewall, Internet router, dynamic DNS, and any internet service provider. For free.
