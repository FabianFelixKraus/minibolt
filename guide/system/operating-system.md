## Which operating system to use?

We use Ubuntu Server LTS (Long Term Support) OS, without a graphical user interface.
This provides the best stability for PC and makes the initial setup a breeze.

Ubuntu Server is based on the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/){:target="_blank"} Linux distribution, which is available for most hardware platforms.
To make this guide as universal as possible, it uses only standard Debian commands.
As a result, it should work smoothly with a personal computer while still being compatible with most other hardware platforms running Debian.

## Get Ubuntu Server

In order to write the operating system to the external drive, we will use the [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/){:target="_blank"} application, download the correct binarie accordly to your OS.

* Download Ubuntu Server LTS doing click [here](https://softlibre.unizar.es/ubuntu/releases/22.04.1/ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso)
* Start the Balena Etcher
* Select "Flash from file" > Select Ubuntu Server LTS .iso file previously downloaded

## Write the operating system to the pen drive

* Connect pen drive to your regular computer
* Click on "Select target"
* Select your pen drive unit
* Click on "Flash!"

Balena Etcher will now flash the operating system to your drive and validate it. It should display a "Flash Complete!" message after.

## Start your PC

* Safely eject the pen drive from your regular computer
* Connect it to your selected PC to the MiniBolt node
* Attach a screen, a keyboard and the Ethernet wire (not case for Wifi connection) to the PC and start it
* Press the key fastly to enter to BIOS setup or directly to the boot menu to select the pen drive as the boot device (normally F9, Esc, F12, or Supr keys)

    üí° If you want to use a secondary unit storage to storage data (blockchain, indexes, etc), you have to:

    * > Format the secondary unit storage as Ext4 filesystem type and mount `"/data"` directory on it. Press done

    üö® In this case, when you are log in with the `"admin"` user, remember to assign the owner of the `/data` directory to the `"admin"` user, in the step [data directory](https://twofaktor.github.io/minibolt/guide/system/configuration.html#data-directory), discarding the creating of the `"/data"` folder already created in the before step.
