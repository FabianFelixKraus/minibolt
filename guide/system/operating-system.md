## Which operating system to use?

We use Ubuntu Server Operating System, without a graphical user interface, and in the 64-bit version.
This provides the best stability for PC and makes the initial setup a breeze.

Ubuntu Server is based on the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/){:target="_blank"} Linux distribution, which is available for most  hardware platforms.
To make this guide as universal as possible, it uses only standard Debian commands.
As a result, it should work smoothly with a personal computer while still being compatible with most other hardware platforms running Debian.

## Get Ubuntu Server

In order to write the operating system to the external drive, we will use the [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/){:target="_blank"} application, download the correct binarie accordly to your OS.

* Download Ubuntu Server doing click [here](https://softlibre.unizar.es/ubuntu/releases/22.04.1/ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso)
* Start the Balena Etcher
* Select "Flash from file" > Select Ubuntu Server .iso previously downloaded

## Write the operating system to the pen drive

* Connect pendrive to your regular computer
* Click on "Select target"
* Select your pen drive unit
* Click on "Flash!"

Balena Etcher will now flash the operating system to your drive and validate it. It should display a "Fash Complete!" message after.

## Start your PC

* Safely eject the Pen Drive from your computer
* Connect it to your Personal Computer
* Start the PC and select pen drive as boot device

## Ubuntu Server installation

Use your keyboard to navigate for the options. Use UP, Down and ENTER keys to select your lenguage. Follow the next instructions:

1. Select your keyboard layout and press done

1. Choose "Ubuntu Server" as the base for the installation

1. Check the network connection that you choose to use and take note of your IP obtained automatically through DHCP. Press done

1. Leave empty next option if you don't want to use an HTTP proxy to access. Press done

1. If you don't want to use an alternative mirror for Ubuntu, press done directly

1. Configure a guided storage layout, or create a custom one, you will need to mount a filesystem at primary disk `("/")` and select a boot disk

    üí° If you want to use a secondary disk to storage data (blockchain, indexes, etc), you have to:

    * > Format the secondary disk as Ext4 filesystem type and mount `"/data"` directory on it. Press done

    üö® In this case, when you are log in with the `"admin"` user, remember to assign the owner of the `/data` directory to the `"admin"` user, in the step [data directory](https://twofaktor.github.io/minibolt/guide/system/configuration.html#data-directory), discarding the creating of the `"/data"` folder already created in the before step.

1. Confirm destructive action by selecting the "Continue" option

1. Fill the profile setup form with the follows

    * > **name:** temp
    * > **user:** temp
    * > **server name:** minibolt
    * > **password:** PASSWORD [A]

1. Check "Install OpenSSH server" by pressing the ENTER key and down to select "Done" box and press ENTER again. ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT step!

1. If you want to preinstall some additional software (not recommended), select them, if not, press "done" directly to jump to the installation next step
